# Project Garden (GDN)

Project Garden is a game that takes inspiration from games like Tomodachi Life and Animal Crossing (mostly the latter), and you live on an island which you can customize to your liking, and you can socialize and grow a friendship with the characters.

Instead of being Terrific Tico characters, I've decided to go for something different, but kind of similar; The characters are going to be from an obscure Japanese Anime called たまごっち！(Tamagotchi!) that I used to watch a lot when I was younger (Even though all of it was in Japanese and I couldn't understand a single word of it), which Terrific Tico took a lot of inspiration from (most specifically the character designs).

In the game, you will have your own customizable house, and it will also have a real-time day cycle system (e.g. If it's 18:41PM in real time, it will be 18:41PM in the game). Not exactly sure if this is possible in Roblox Studio though.

Now, don't get me wrong, this will not be a full-time project as of right now, at the current moment. I will still focus on Terrific Tico more than any other project. This will simply just be a side-project I will be working on when I'm burnt out of Terrifc Tico.
